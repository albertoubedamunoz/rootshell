//  AgentUsageCenter.swift

//
//  Orchestrates subscription-usage tracking for live coding agents:
//  presence (from AgentAttentionCenter) -> credential probes on the hosts'
//  own connections -> usage fetches against the providers' APIs -> the
//  sidebar footer. Modelled on AgentAttentionCenter's conventions.
//
//  Tokens read off hosts are held in memory here and NOWHERE else: never
//  persisted, never logged, dropped the moment the feature is disabled.
//  What IS persisted (UserDefaults) are percentages, dates and plan labels,
//  plus the per-account fetch clock — so a relaunch shows last-known usage
//  instantly and cannot be used to sidestep the rate-limit floor.
