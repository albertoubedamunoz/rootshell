//
//  oh-my-pi signs into many providers at once, so one pane is 1:N rather than
//  1:1 and there is no single account to attribute it to. Rather than read
//  its credential store and re-implement a dozen provider APIs, the probe
//  asks oh-my-pi for the answer it already has: `omp usage --json` reports
//  every authenticated account in one normalized payload and caches each
//  provider's result for five minutes internally.
//
//  The upside is that no token ever leaves the host and a provider added
//  upstream needs no change here. The cost is that we are parsing someone
//  else's schema, so every field is treated as optional and a lane that does
//  not parse is dropped rather than guessed at.
