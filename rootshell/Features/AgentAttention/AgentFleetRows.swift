//  Claude Code's background-agent list ("FleetView"), read off the live
//  screen:
//
//      ❯ ⏺ main
//        ◯ Explore  Grepping timeoutChecker…    2m 13s · ↓ 98.9k tokens
//        ◯ Explore  Reading keepAlive…          2m  1s · ↓ 111.2k tokens
//
//  Manifest rules can say "a fleet list is on screen", but not "an agent
//  in it is still running": a rule keyed on the list alone would pin the
//  pane working forever, and a replayed frame (tmux attach, launch
//  restore) holds a whole list of frozen timers. What no format guess is
//  needed for is a row's own timer ADVANCING between two scans; that is
//  what this parser feeds — unlike the byte-activity heuristic that
//  ROUND 9 removed.
//
//  ⛔ The agent NAME cannot key a row. Claude runs several agents under
//  one name, and keying scans by it collapsed three concurrent Explores
//  into one slot, so the card read "1 agent" for a three-agent fleet.
//
//  Pure string work, no UIKit: compiled into the standalone test harness
//  alongside AgentDetectionRegions.
